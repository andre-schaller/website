      I work as a Security Engineering Engineer at [EUMETSAT](https://www.eumetsat.int) and provide my expertise in cyber security as a freelancer. Prior to that I have been working as a Cyber Security researcher at [CYSEC](https://cysec.tu-darmstadt.de) / Technical University Darmstadt, Germany, where I graduated as a Doctor of Engineering as a member of the Security Engineering research group. Working on cutting-edge Cyber Security research projects, I gained experience in various fields including information security, engineering of secure protocols and applications, lightweight cryptography and security of embedded devices.
